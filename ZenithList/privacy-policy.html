    <h1>Privacy Policy for Zenith List</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 19, 2025</p>

    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how Zenith List ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our mobile application (the "Service").
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        We collect the following types of information to provide and improve our Service:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your username and email address.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> We store the tasks you create, including titles, descriptions, due dates, priority levels, subtasks, and tags.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Anonymous Users:</strong> We provide an option to use the app anonymously. In this case, a unique user ID is generated, but no personal email or username is collected.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide, maintain, and improve the core functionality of the to-do list application.</li>
        <li>To sync your tasks across devices using your account.</li>
        <li>To manage your gamification progress, including points, levels, and streaks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        Zenith List uses Google Firebase to provide its backend services. Your data is stored and managed using the following Firebase products:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Firebase Authentication:</strong> To manage user sign-up, login, and account security.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cloud Firestore:</strong> To securely store your account information and task data.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For more information, you can review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>AI Task Generation Feature</h2>
    <p>
        Zenith List offers an optional feature that allows you to generate tasks using an external AI service. To use this feature, you must provide your own API key from a third-party AI provider (e.g., OpenAI).
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Your API key is stored securely on your device using `expo-secure-store` and is only used to make direct calls from your device to the AI provider's API.
        </li>
        <li>
            We do not have access to, collect, or store your personal API key on our servers.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We are committed to protecting your data. We leverage the robust security measures of Google's Cloud Firestore to store your information, which includes rules to ensure that only you can access your own data.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        You may request the deletion of your account and all associated data at any time. To do so, please contact us at [YOUR_SUPPORT_EMAIL@example.com].

        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
